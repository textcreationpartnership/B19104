            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

We have thought fit to grant a Commission un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Our Great Seale of England to diverse Persons of Honour, quality and integrity of that County, to intend and mannage that Service, who (assisted with such of Our Commanders as We have joyned with them in the said Commission) We presume will be as carefull of the good and welfare of Our Subjects there, as of the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Our Service. We doe hereby declare, That from henceforward no Souldier or Officer of Our Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons in that County shall presume (otherwise then as by vertue of Our said Commission, if he be thereby authorised so to doe) to send any Warrant for Contribution, or any mony whatsoever, but We expect that Our said Commissioners shall first be informed what proportion is necessary for the weekly payment and support of Our severall Garrisons, And thereupon having equally distributed the same upon the severall divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and Hundreds of Our said County, shall take such care that the same be orderly collected and paid to the Governors and Officers of Our said Garrisons, at the places and time agreed upon, that the Souldiers, for want of their due supply, may not be compelled to break Our Commands. And if any extraordinary Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent shall fall out, either by the refractarinesse of any Persons, or by reason of the Rebells being possessed of any places in that County, that the mony, appoynted by Our said Commissioners to he collected and paid, be not brought in accordingly, then Our pleasure is, That according to the direction and Warrant of Our said Commissioners, Our Governors of Our said Garrisons shall assist the said Collection in such manner as shall bethought fit and necessary. And We doe straitly command and require all the Officers and Souldiers of Our Army that they precisely observe Our Commands expressed in this Our Proclamation, and that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume not upon any reasons or pretences whatsoever, to offer any violence to any of Our loving Subjects within that Our County, or to take away their Horses, or to doe them any other dammage or injury, as they will answer the contrary at their utmost perills.</p>
